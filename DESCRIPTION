Description: This package enables embedding time in the R prompt by treating
   the options()$prompt string as a strftime format string. The package contains a
   C library which replaces the default R_ReadConsole function. This is the
   function responsible for reading one line of input when R is running in
   interactive mode.
Depends: R (>= 3.0.2)
